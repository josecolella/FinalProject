Final Project
=============

José Miguel Colella
-------------------

Todos
=====

- Integrate BoxPlot, StackedArea, and table
- Integrate Examples
- Integrate Tutorial
- Test the export module

- Using vex for modals, integrate them into the examples
    - Vex will be used to load the modal of the examples of
    the visualization models.
        - One way to do is is that each “Show example” loads the example dinamically
        of the each model has an Example description. The first way is better as it
        allows for custom example input.





- Add users
- Integrate github, facebook, twitter, google service
- Integrate dropbox and drive functionality


Notes
=====

- Use MediaElement.js for videos
- Use Embed.ly to put videos inside modals
- For each example a modal should be shown with an example of how to use the
visualization model


Future Features
