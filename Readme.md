Todos
=====

- After the user has uploaded a file, if the user should click on a file, the information is loaded to the excel chart so that the user may view it.
- Using vex for modals, integrate them into the examples
    - Vex will be used to load the modal of the examples of
    the visualization models.
        - One way to do is is that each “Show example” loads the example dinamically
        of the each model has an Example description. The first way is better as it
        allows for custom example input.

- integrate the spreadsheet with the graph so that it displays as the user writes to screen
- integrate the editor with nvd3
- finish adding the graphs images and effects
- Integrate the import functionality as a view
- Add users
- Integrate github, facebook, twitter, google service
- Integrate dropbox and drive functionality


Notes
=====

- Use MediaElement.js for videos
- Use Embed.ly to put videos inside modals
- For each example a modal should be shown with an example of how to use the
visualization model
