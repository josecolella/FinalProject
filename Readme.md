Todos
=====

- Using vex for modals, integrate them into the examples 
    - Vex will be used to load the modal of the examples of
    the visualization models. 
        - One way to do is is that each “Show example” loads the example dinamically
        of the each model has an Example description. The first way is better as it 
        allows for custom example input.
- Add draggable effect
    - HTML5 of JQuery UI

- integrate the editor with nvd3
- finish adding the graphs images and effects
- Integrate the import functionality as a view

Notes
=====

- Use MediaElement.js for videos
- Use Embed.ly to put videos inside modals
- For each example a modal should be shown with an example of how to use the
visualization model

For the images user draggable="true" ondragstart="drag(event)"
